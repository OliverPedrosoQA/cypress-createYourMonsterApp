# Test Automation Project with Cypress and Page Object Model - Create Your Monster web game.

üëã Welcome!

This repository houses a test automation project utilizing Cypress and JavaScript to automate end-to-end tests for a demo game webpage.

## The Application 

The game app that had its tests automated is a single page web app build with react. The purpose of this game is to create Monster cards by selecting the Monster, and filling out a form with the fields Name, HP, Attack, Defense and Speed. The app uses data-testids which is a best practice in test automation, and enables the use of selectors without the need of CSS elements being incorporated in the assertions.

##  Project Structure

In order to create end-to-end tests the framework Cypress.io was installed and the Page Object Model (POM) was the architecture chosen for this project. 

To enhance test organization and maintainability, this project leverages Custom Commands. These commands implement functions containing the test steps, which are then called by the Context functions in the spec files.

## Pre-requirements

It is required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

> I developed this project using Node.js v18.17.0 and npm 9.8.1. I recommend using the same versions or later. Additionally, the project was tested with Git 2.41.0.windows.3, Google Chrome 120.0.6099.130 (x86_64), and Visual Studio Code 1.84.2.

## Installation

Run `npm install` (or `npm i` for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests

These are the different ways to run this project. The code can be found in the package.json file:

* `npm run cy:open`: Open Cypress in interactive mode.
* `npm run dev`: Starts the application on devmode on the port:3000.
